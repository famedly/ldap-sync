# Famedly Sync

This tool synchronizes users from different sources to Famedly's Zitadel instance.

Currently supported sources:
- LDAP
- CSV
- Custom endpoint provided by UKT

## Configuration

The tool expects a configuration file located at `./config.yaml`. See example configuration at [config.sample.yaml](./config.sample.yaml).

The default path can be changed by setting the new path to the environment variable `FAMEDLY_LDAP_SYNC_CONFIG`.

Also, individual configuration items and the whole configuration can be set using environment variables. For example, the following YAML configuration:

```yaml
sources:
  ldap:
    url: ldap://localhost:1389
```

Could be set using the following environment variable:

```bash
FAMEDLY_LDAP_SYNC__SOURCES__LDAP__URL="ldap://localhost:1389"
```

Note that the environment variable name always starts with the prefix `FAMEDLY_LDAP_SYNC` followed by keys separated by double underscores (`__`).

Some configuration items take a list of values. In this cases the values should be separated by space. **If an empty list is desired the variable shouldn't be created.**

Config can have **various sources** to sync from. When a source is configured, the sync tool tries to update users in Famedly's Zitadel instance based on the data obtained from the source.

**Feature flags** are optional and can be used to enable or disable certain features.

## Testing & Development

This repository uses [`nextest`](https://nexte.st/) to perform test
env spin-up and teardown. To install it, either see their website, or
run:

```
cargo install cargo-nextest --locked
```

Tests can then be run using:

```
cargo nextest run [--no-fail-fast] [-E 'test(<specific_test_to_run>)']
```

Note that tests need to be executed from the repository root since we
do not currently implement anything to find files required for tests
relative to it.

In addition, a modern docker with the `compose` subcommand is
required - importantly, this is not true for many distro docker
packages. Firewalls also need to be configured to allow container <->
container as well as container <-> host communication.

### E2E test architecture

For e2e testing, we need an ldap and a zitadel instance to test
against. These are spun up using docker compose.

After ldap and zitadel have spun up, another docker container runs,
which simply executes a script to clean up existing test data and
create the necessary pre-setup organization structures to support a
test run.

Tests are then expected to directly communicate with ldap/zitadel to
create/delete/modify users and confirm test results.

Importantly, since the tests run with no teardown between individual
tests, users created *must* have different LDAP ID/email addresses, so
that they can be managed independently.

E2E tests cannot run concurrently, since this would cause
synchronization to happen concurrently.

For LDAP-over-TLS, openldap is configured to allow connections without
client certificates, but if one is provided, it must be verified
correctly. This allows us to test scenarios with and without client
certificates.

## Contributing

### Pre-commit usage

1. If not installed, install with your package manager, or `pip install --user pre-commit`
2. Run `pre-commit autoupdate` to update the pre-commit config to use the newest template
3. Run `pre-commit install` to install the pre-commit hooks to your local environment

## Deployment

The easiest way to deploy this tool is using our published docker
container through our [composefile](./docker-compose.yaml).

To prepare for use, we need to provide a handful of files in an `opt`
directory in the directory where `docker compose` will be
executed. This is the expected directory structure of the sample
configuration file:

```
opt
├── certs
│  └── test-ldap.crt   # The TLS certificate of the LDAP server
├── config.yaml        # An example can be found in config.sample.yaml
└── service-user.json  # Provided by famedly
```

Once this is in place, the container can be executed in the parent
directory of `opt` with:

```
docker compose up
```

Or alternatively, without `docker compose`:

```
docker run --rm -it --network host --volume ./opt:/opt/famedly-sync-agent docker-oss.nexus.famedly.de/famedly-sync-agent:latest
```

### Kubernetes Deployment

The provided manifest `ldap-sync-cronjob.yaml` can be used
to deploy this tool as a CronJob on a Kubernetes cluster.

```
kubectl create -f ldap-sync-deployment.yaml
```

It will run `docker-oss.nexus.famedly.de/famedly-sync-agent:v0.4.0` once per day
at 00:00 in the namespace `ldap-sync`. It requires a ConfigMap named `famedly-sync`
to be present in the `ldap-sync` namespace. The ConfigMap can be created using

```
kubectl create configmap --from-file config.yaml famedly-sync --namespace ldap-sync
```

## Quirks & Edge Cases

- Changing a user's LDAP id (the attribute from the `user_id` setting)
  is unsupported, as this is used to identify the user on the Zitadel
  end.
- Disabling a user on the LDAP side (with `status`) results in the
  user being deleted from Zitadel.
- Providing multiple values for an LDAP attribute is not supported.
- Zitadel's API is not fully atomic; if a request fails, a user may
  not be fully created and still not be functional even if the tool is
  re-used.
  - In particular, the matrix localpart, the preferred user name, and
    whether the user has permissions to use Famedly may not be synced.
- If a user's email or phone number changes, they will only be
  prompted to verify it if the tool is configured to make users verify
  them.
- Changing a user's email also immediately results in a new
  login/username.
- If SSO is turned on later, existing users will not be linked.
